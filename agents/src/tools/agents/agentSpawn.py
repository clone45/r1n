                This function provides a way to spawn a new agent.  
                This is especially useful when you need to spawn a new agent to handle a specific task, 
                  or if you want to make updates to the codebase and use another agent to test it out. 
                Agents can be stopped by sending them a single 'quit' statement on the message bus. 
                If you don't provide a folder name, the default agent will be used.  To check what agent folders are available, you can use the agentsList tool.
                If you want to reset the agent, you can set the reset parameter to True.  This will re-register the agent with the LLM.  
                Typically, you will only want to reset an agent if you are changing the definition of an agent.  If you don't need this, don't provide it.
