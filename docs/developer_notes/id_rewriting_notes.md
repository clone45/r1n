Considerations for MongoDB Usage:
If you are frequently needing to convert _id to id across different parts of your application, you might consider a more centralized approach to handle this transformation, such as using Mongoose middleware or modifying the schema to include virtuals that automatically handle these transformations:

Using Mongoose Schema Virtuals for ID
You can also add a virtual property to your Mongoose schema that will automatically handle this for all instances of the model:

javascript
Copy code
// Inside your Role model definition
RoleSchema.virtual('id').get(function () {
    return this._id.toHexString();
});

RoleSchema.set('toJSON', {
    virtuals: true,
    versionKey: false,
    transform: function (doc, ret) { delete ret._id; }
});
This approach modifies the toJSON behavior of the schema to include the id virtual when converting to JSON and to remove the _id and __v (version key) fields, thus streamlining the response object structure.

Using this schema-based approach ensures that every time a Role model instance is converted to JSON, it automatically appears with the id and without the _id, reducing the need for manual transformations in every API route.
