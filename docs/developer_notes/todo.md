* 

- persist threads
- delete team
- upload file for processing during a run (drag and drop)
- rewrite polling in interact function

Set goals for MVP

- deleting a profile should remove that profile from all teams
- handle 

Demo script
============
start application
load team
ask Rin to list out the files in the current work directory
ask Rin to identify other team members


Rin, does Jenna have any tools that she can utilize for us?
Hello Rin!  What files are in the current working directory?
Can you tell Jenna an interactive knock-knock joke?  (If Jenna asks for additional jokes, tell them that's the only one you know.)



Later this week
 - Create a function for using perplexity
 - Add a tool definition for enabling Code Interpreter

 - try to implement Mixtral with function calling
 - Add configuration for adding credentials
 - Start thinking of persistance / thread_ids, etc.
 - Start thinking of improving the UI to handle large conversations
 - Take a deeper look at open_ai_agent and ollama_agent.  Are these necessary?
 - rename io to message_brokers
 - check if custom_logger.py is still necessary
 - figure out how to clean up agents/storage, which gets created (I think) by Docker
 - ability to upload file into conversation

a "team_management" tools collection 
  - create_team
  - load team
  - reload team

- what about renaming profiles to assistants?


What if the interface (server.js), not put a message on the RabbitMQ bus, but rather called a webservice to do this?
When a team is running, each profile has it's own webservice that allows communication from the outside world. This
webservice simply provides a conduit between the world and the message bus?

This would allow things like Slack to talk to agents directly.  Maybe the calls to the webservice need to pass a 
callback to get the response?  (in case it could take a while)


WHAT IF tools didn't do anything except call an API, which did all of the work?
Or, at least make such tools easy to use.
-------------
Cons: 
* More work for developers and agents to create new tools.  More complex.
* Maybe a few milliseconds slower

Pros: 
* Opens up the possibility to run tools directly from outside of the system
* Makes tools eaiser to test
* if tools can include optional endpoint address, tools can be run on remote machines
* a tool that crashes will not crash the framework

Tools
-----

The agentSpawn tool needs some work.  I might consider renaming it "roleSpawn", and adjusting
the parameters.  Or, I could refactor it to be "profileSpawn" << this seems most appropriate.


profile actions
- add ability to reset an assistant from the user interface (??)
- Start writing documentation

- Copy FSM idea.  Use python for control logic?  (That does make it really powerful.)

talking out loud:  If the interface is supposed to be abstracted, meaning that other interfaces could replace it, then should the agents be posting messages TO the user interface, even if the recipipent may eventually something else?  Or should there be some type of message router?  This reminds me of the idea that I've already written down where "listeners" are set up to be informed when certain things happen.

!! give agents the ability to learn new skills when confronted with a question they cannot do.
  Also allow themselves to add it to their skillset in the config file
  These two will be a must when learning new skills

- Implement Claude 3 w/function calling
- Implement groq w/function calling

* Make the 'interact' and all subsequent calls async to that we can use the create_and_poll metho

Because the concept of assistants are open ai centric.

* Detach tool running from the main script so it's possible to modify tools during the main agent's run
* Start thinking about getting self-modifying code working


spawning, and protocols
---
* rename from_queue and to_queue to be something more transport agnostic, because http might be a thing
* or add a protocal method?
* at the moment, I'm spawinging teams using server.js.  However, this assumes that
  the agents are running on the same machine as the server.  Instead, new teams should probably 
  be created by sending a message on the message bus to a daemon (recruiter?) that runs on a machine


I need a way to save the entire state of everything, so that people can pick up where they left off, and also start new projects without losing the old ones.

UI updates:
=============
* When the backend is closed, the UI should notice and go dormant
* When a team is loaded, check to see if the agents already exist and don't reload them, otherwise they might 
  double if the backend is restarted
* integrate papertrail logging into React application
* interface for creating new roles
* multi-modal (files/attachments)
* Show a running session cost on the interface
* Notify users that they'll need to reload team members before seeing any profile updates (using profile management)

ideas:
=============
* test driven development
* CI/CD pipeline
* Ensure that incoming messages are time stamped.  Include "time since last message"
* Create file manager -> provide Rin file manager capabilities and interface
  - Allow all agents the ability to launch RAG file upload from within the chat
* Built in Message bus viewer
  - or, maybe just a generic activity viewer on a collapable right side panel, with filters and such
* Support HTTP protocol
* Add a "Learn More" secondary button to each team in the Select a Team menu
* Support webhooks for various actions, such as the user receiving a new message
* For all front-end UI features, provide listeners on the websockets to allow agents to control things
* When a team only has one member, change the user experience and get rid of the member selection panel
* decouple the user experience.  Maybe Slack would be the user, or text message, or email
  This could be done using some type of router where messages go before server.js.
  Agents, instead of sending it to the UI, would send it to a human persona
* allow for front-end plugins
* add storage management.  Provide a way to grant addess to storage to either a team or an agent.
- allow teams to have vector stores (important!) -- essentially a shared vector store
* Would it be possible to ask the agent to duplicate their output from the communicate tool when responding directly
to conversations, and stream the direct output when responding to users?  (Seems unlikely.)

tools
- Create a tool to schedule an event (as opposed to the timer)
- update logging in agent_factory.py

Longer term
==============
- reload the last team used, or provide a "default" team that loads on startup
- audit the RabbitMQ security and require a password and such
- allow agents to have multiple vector stores
- patch up chromDB functions after moving to storage
- near realtime application visualizer showing communication too and from components

Summary of Network Connectivity Tests
Ping Test:
Objective: Confirm basic network visibility between the Node.js application container and the RabbitMQ container.
Method: Used the ping command from the Node.js container to check if the RabbitMQ service container (rabbitmq) is reachable by its Docker Compose service name.
Result: Successful - the ping command was able to resolve the hostname and receive responses from the RabbitMQ container, confirming that basic network connectivity exists.
Port Accessibility Test with Netcat (nc):
Objective: Verify that the specific AMQP port (5672) is accessible and that RabbitMQ is listening on this port from the Node.js container.
Method: Attempted to use nc to test connectivity to RabbitMQ on port 5672.
Result: Netcat was not functioning or available in the container, so the test could not be completed using nc.
Port Accessibility Test with Telnet:
Objective: Test and confirm that the TCP port (5672) RabbitMQ is using is open and can accept connections, as an alternative to Netcat.
Method: Installed and used telnet in the Node.js container to connect to the RabbitMQ service on port 5672.
Result: Successful - tellet was able to connect to RabbitMQ on the specified port, confirming that the service is active and accepting TCP connections on port 5672.
These tests collectively helped diagnose and confirm that there are no underlying network issues preventing connectivity between the Node.js application and RabbitMQ within the Docker environment. Each step provided additional confirmation of network setup correctness and service availability.


Instead of waiting for 3 seconds in discoverTeamMembers, consider this:

## Use the database
How about just querying the database?  The only downfall is that agents who have been added to the interface but not
to the team might not immediately show up.  However, I think it's a good solution anyhow.

## Check Queue Consumer Count
To get more direct information about consumers, you would look at each queue bound to the exchange and check the number of consumers subscribed to each queue. This method requires aggregating data from multiple queues, which can be done programmatically:

    Use the RabbitMQ Management HTTP API to list all queues and their details:
    Endpoint: GET /api/queues
    This endpoint provides data for each queue, including the number of consumers.
    Hereâ€™s an example using Python with requests to access the RabbitMQ Management API to get consumer counts for queues bound to a specific exchange:

    def get_consumers_for_exchange(base_url, vhost, exchange_name, username, password):
        # Get all bindings for the specified exchange
        bindings_url = f"{base_url}/api/exchanges/{vhost}/{exchange_name}/bindings/source"
        bindings_response = requests.get(bindings_url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password))
        bindings = bindings_response.json()
        
        # Get details for each queue bound to the exchange
        total_consumers = 0
        for binding in bindings:
            queue_name = binding['destination']
            queue_url = f"{base_url}/api/queues/{vhost}/{queue_name}"
            queue_response = requests.get(queue_url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password))
            queue_info = queue_response.json()
            total_consumers += queue_info.get('consumers', 0)
        
        return total_consumers
